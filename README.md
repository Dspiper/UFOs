# UFOs Analysis

## Overview: 
Provide an in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. The webpage and dynamic table will update with the results for the date, city, state, country, and shape filters set by the users. 

## Results:
With the new webpage design users are able to filter the results on multiple criteria: date, city, state, country, and shape. Filters are located under Filer Search and conatin a static placeholder to help users understand how to enter their search. 

When a user is ready to search they can enter criteria in any of the five search fields then press enter to return the filtered results. In the following example, the results are filtered by state ("fl") and country ("us"). 

If no results can be found for the criteria entered by the user an empty table will be returned. The search criteria can be cleared by clicking "UFO Sightings" at the top of the page. 

## Summary: 
On drawback of the new design of the webpage is that it does not return any error messages for criteria entered incorrectly. A recommendation for future development would be to have error messages for search criteria entered incorrectly and a message when no results are found. Another recommenation would be to have drop-down menus with avaiable search criteria for the date, city, state, country and shape fields. This would help users by provding them a list of the criteria avaiable to filter the table.
